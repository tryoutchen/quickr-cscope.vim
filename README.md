# quickr-cscope.vim
Vim plugin for super fast Cscope results navigation using quickfix window.

## Features
`quickr-cscope.vim` provides faster access to
[Cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/) database search queries within Vim.
Each type of Cscope query is just a keystroke away. Results are shown in a
[quickfix](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html) window ready for 
faster navigation. Paired with excellent [quickfix-reflector.vim](https://github.com/stefandtw/quickfix-reflector.vim)
plugin, `quickr-cscope.vim` is a powerful tool for project navigation and
refactoring.

Biggest advantage of using this plugin is, it prevents the
quickfix to jump to first result automatically. Thus preventing it to spoil
your open buffer list.

* Quickly search for symbol, function name, file name under the cursor
* Quickly search for visually selected text
* Search results are shown in quickfix window, which is way more flexible for
  navigation compared to Cscope's fixed list
* Search term can be navigated using `n` and `N` in quickfix window for faster
  movement
* Find the Cscope database and load automatically on startup
* Also works with [GNU GLOBAL](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/manual/global.html) database

## Installation

This plugin follows the standard runtime path structure, and as such it can be
installed with a variety of plugin managers:

*  [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
  - `git clone https://github.com/ronakg/quickr-cscope.vim ~/.vim/bundle/quickr-cscope.vim`
*  [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
  - `NeoBundle 'ronakg/quickr-cscope.vim'`
*  [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
  - `Plugin 'ronakg/quickr-cscope.vim'`
*  [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  - `Plug 'ronakg/quickr-cscope.vim'`
*  Manual
  - copy all of the files into your `~/.vim` directory

## Default Key maps

```vim
<leader>s : Search for all symbol occurances of word under the cursor
<leader>g : Search for global definition of the word under the cursor
<leader>c : Search for all callers of the function name under the cursor
<leader>f : Search for all files matching filename under the cursor
<leader>i : Search for all files including filename under the cursor
<leader>t : Search for text matching word under the cursor/visualy selected text
<leader>e : Enter an egrep patter for searching
<leader>d : Search all the functions called by funtion name under the cursor
```

P.S.: `\` is the leader key by default. So the mappings are `\s`, `\g`, `\c`, etc. unless `<leader>` key is mapped to something else.

## Customization

### Disable default key mappings
If you want to use your own key mappings, you can disable the default key
mappings by adding following to your `~/.vimrc` file.

```vim
let g:quickr_cscope_keymaps = 0
```

### Define custom key mappings

Use following `<plug>`s to your own liking:

```vim
<plug>(quickr_cscope_symbols)
<plug>(quickr_cscope_global)
<plug>(quickr_cscope_callers)
<plug>(quickr_cscope_files)
<plug>(quickr_cscope_includes)
<plug>(quickr_cscope_text)
<plug>(quickr_cscope_egrep)
<plug>(quickr_cscope_functions)
```

For example:

```vim
nmap <C-s> <plug>(quickr_cscope_symbols)
```

### Use GNU GLOBAL instead of Cscope
If you want to use GNU GLOBAL for searching your codebase, it can be done by 
define following in your `~/.vimrc`.

```vim
let g:quickr_cscope_program = "gtags-cscope"
let g:quickr_cscope_db_file = "GTAGS"
```

### Disable automatic search and load of Cscope database
If you're already using another Cscope plugin that loads the database, you can
disable this feature of the plugin by adding following to your `~/.vimrc`.

```vim
let g:quickr_cscope_autoload_db = 0
```

## FAQ

**I'm not able to use `Ctrl-T` to go back in tag stack like I used to before.**

When you use quickfix to view results of a Cscope query, those results
are not passed to taglist. You need to use `Ctrl-o` (jumplist) to go back to
where you were from a result.

**When there are multiple matches for global definition, it doesn't open in quickfix window.**

By default global definitions are not shown in quickfix window. This
behavior can be set by setting `g:quickr_cscope_use_qf_g` to `1`.

```vim
let g:quickr_cscope_use_qf_g = 1
```
